/*!
 * \brief An application which may be hosted by SAFE-DART.
 *
 * By providing an implementation of Application which may be discovered via
 * reflection (see Reflectable), a module may provide an entry point which may
 * be used by SAFE-DART to run an application.
 *
 * An implementation of Application needs to do nothing besides provide a
 * \c main method SAFE-DART can call to execute the application. It is optional
 * (but recommended) that the implementation has a constructor which takes a
 * <tt>Builder *</tt> as a parameter in order for the application to be able to
 * dynamically instantiate other types using SAFE-DART. See
 * \c Builder::get(const char *) for more information about construction.

     * \brief The entry point for an application hosted by SAFE-DART.

     * signature, so applications can be written in much the same way as with an
     * executable.

     * \param argv The command-line arguments given to the application, as given
     * by the operating system.
     *
     * \return The result of running the application.
     * \retval 0 The application completed successfully.
     * \retval !0 The application completed with an error.
