 * \brief Builds and caches objects created through reflection.
 *
 * Builder is the foundation of the SAFE-DART architecture. It provides an
 * interface through which software can instantiate objects using reflection.
 * Instantiating objects this way allows the implementation types to be changed
 * without needing to recompile the software.
 *
 * Builder uses a configuration file which specifies which types to instantiate.
 * This allows the objects that are instantiated to be configured at run-time
 * without any additional effort required by the caller, allowing the
 * application to be reconfigured at run-time with minimal effort. With the use
 * of shared libraries, this can also allow functionality to be added or changed
 * without the need to recompile the entire software.
 *
 * Builder also keeps track of the instances it creates, reusing them when the
 * type is requested again. When an instance of Builder is used by multiple
 * libraries, this also means that any objects instantiated by the Builder may
 * be shared between those libraries.
