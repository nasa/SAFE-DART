/*!
 * \brief Automatically registers a type for reflection on initialization.
 *
 * Reflection is the ability for software to get information about types that
 * exist within the software at run-time. This can be used for many things,
 * including getting information about what constructors, functions, and
 * properties are available on a type at run-time, as well as instantiating
 * types dynamically at run-time.
 *
 * In order for a custom type to be usable via reflection, it must be registered
 * with Qt by calling <tt>qMetaTypeId<T>()</tt> for that type. This class
 * provides a way of doing so automatically at initialization time, with
 * minimal extra code.
 *
 * In order to use this class, simply extend any class T which should be
 * accessible via reflection from <tt>Reflectable&lt;T&gt;</tt>.
 *
 * \warning This will always work when the subclass is compiled as part of an
 * executable or shared library. However, it will only work in a static library
 * if the class is referenced directly by other code that is in use. Otherwise,
 * the linker will eliminate initialization of the unused class and it will not
 * be available through reflection.

     * isn't important, so marking it as unused is sufficient.
