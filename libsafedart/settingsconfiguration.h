/*!
 * \brief An implementation of Configuration which stores its configuration data
 * in QSettings.
 *
 * SettingsConfiguration uses QSettings, which is persistent; as a result, it is
 * useful for use in production software for storing editable configuration data.
 *
 * Custom configuration files can be shared throughout the software by extending
 * SettingsConfiguration. Create a no-arg constructor which constructs the
 * underlying SettingsConfiguration with an appropriately configured QSettings.
 * This subtype can then be managed via a Builder.
