 * \brief An implementation of Configuration which uses the SAFE configuration

 * Implementing a subclass of SettingsConfiguration which represents a specific
 * configuration file allows a Builder to create and manage the Configuration so
 * that it can be accessed through any code which has access to the Builder.
 *
 * This may also serve as a template for a Configuration which uses a
 * software-specific configuration file via QSettings.
