/*!
 * \brief An implementation of Application which implements the functionality of
 * the SAFE host executable.
 *
 * SafeApplication implements the functionality of the SAFE host executable. It
 * primarily does three things:
 *
 * \li Load SAFE configuration
 * \li Load modules (from ./mod)
 * \li Execute configured Application
 *
 * This approach allows for the SAFE executable to host an Application from a
 * module, optionally passing the Builder as a constructor parameter to allow
 * access to objects provided by other modules. This means that software code
 * may be heavily compartmentalized into different modules, allowing for code
 * to be extensible and flexible.
 *
 * This may also serve as a template for an Application which is designed to be
 * hosted within SAFE. Note that in that case, the implementation must extend
 * Reflectable and its constructor must be Q_INVOKABLE.
 *
 * \ingroup SAFE-DART-Host
